# pydeutils_test

This Processing.py `.pyde` sketch demonstrates some of the utilities in
pydeutils.

Open the sketch using Processing -- the Processing Development Environment
(PDE) application.

If you are testing directly in the pydeutils download, the pydeutils
package should be imported via a symlink subdirectory inside the sketch
folder. If it is not, copy the pydeutils package directory into the sketch
folder before running the sketch.

A limitation of Processing.py mode is that the sketch name *must* match the
enclosing directory name. This is in order to conform to the naming
requirements of Processing(Java).
